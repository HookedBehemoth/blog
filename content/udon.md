Note: 
This is my first blog post, so be forgiving.

## Introduction
VRChat is a social VR platform built on [Unity3D](https://unity.com/).
Its users can upload their 3D assets, such as Avatars and Worlds.
To provide interaction, a scripting language is provided.
It's called UDON.

When I was introduced to VRChat, I eventually got invited to learn the Japanese tile game [Riichi Mahjong](https://riichi.wiki/Main_Page) in the [Chiitoitsu Parlor](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_553fc2ff-d875-4eb0-98a1-70531b8c7ae2).
The game is best played with three or four players.
The table [Prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) allows you to stack up players with CPU-controlled bots/NPCs (non-player characters).

Over time I got annoyed by the bad performance I had to endure while playing this game.

## About UDON
Udon is an interpreted bytecode language for client-sided functionality in VRChat environments.
Each script is bound to an object where one player implicitly or explicitly takes ownership.

It consists of a fixed-size heap, a stack and nine variable-length instructions (4 or 8 bytes).
These are as follows:

| Instruction | Description |
|-|-|
| NOP | Nothing |
| PUSH | Pushes a heap index to the stack |
| POP | Removes the last index from the stack |
| JUMP_IF_FALSE | Jumps to a set instruction if the last value on the stack evaluates to true |
| JUMP | Jump to a set instruction |
| EXTERN | Call an exported function outside the VM |
| ANNOTATION | Prints a variable of the heap |
| JUMP_INDIRECT | Loads an index of the heap and jumps to this instruction |
| COPY | Copy one value of the heap to another index |

`NOP`, `POP` and `ANNOTATION` aren't commonly used, so we are only left with six useful instructions.

The interpreter is implemented as a simple switch in a loop, as such
```rs
loop {
    match code[pc] {
        NOP => { /* ... */ }
        PUSH { idx } => { stack.push(idx) }
        POP => { stack.pop() }
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Since you wouldn't want to write assembly directly, you can choose higher-level languages and compilers.

### Node Graphs
{{ image(path="/blog/udon/graph.png") }}

The VRChat team made this one.
Unfortunately, it's still very limited.
Function calls and recursion are very clunky.

This caused the community to develop alternatives.

### UdonPieCompiler
```py
from .UdonPie import *

def _start():
    res = func(3, 23)
    Debug.Log(Object(res))

def func(lhs: Int32, rhs: Int32) -> Int32:
    lhs * rhs
```
This one uses a limited python language subset. Function calls are easy here but come with their own issues.
For example, `EXTERN` function signatures need to be manually updated, and python doesn't integrate well into the Unity Editor.

### UdonSharp
```cs
public class SpinningCubes : UdonSharpBehaviour {
    private void Update() {
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, 1f);
    }
}
```
Inspired by UdonPieCompiler, MerlinVR developed a C# compiler.
Since traditional Unity scripting is done in this language, this is a well fit.
In addition, most previous issues have been resolved, and even recursion is possible.

Merlin is also well known for releasing various tools to help VRChat world creators like [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo), which uses UdonSharp.
To this date, it is the most used compiler, and most shared assets require it.
VRChat has since hired Merlin, who intends to improve UDON.

### Katsudon
An honourable mention goes to Katsudon, which I haven't looked into enough.

## Slow down
However, all these are compiled down to the assembly language mentioned above.
Six instructions isnâ€™t a lot compared to other Virtual Machines.
Java's JVM currently has [203](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_bytecode_instructions).
Microsoft's CIL, used by C#, has [229](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CIL_instructions).
Your CPU runs on over a thousand different instructions.

If you are familiar with how any of these work, you might wonder how basic arithmetic operations function.

### EXTERN
To get anything to happen, UDON code uses its sixth instruction to call into external functions. A simple float addition looks like this:
```asm
PUSH lhs
PUSH rhs
PUSH output
EXTERN "SystemSingle.__op_Addition__SystemSingle_SystemSingle__SystemSingle"
```

This is **slow**. How slow? In my testing, running against the same C# code running in a mono runtime, **200 times** slower.
This might not be an issue for UDON's intended use case, but the creative world moves on, and simple buttons and switches aren't the only things around.
The Mahjong prefab we are using consists of over 6'000 lines of code and compiles to roughly 28'000 instructions. Of those, over 4'000 are "EXTERN" calls.

{{ side_note(text="You could probably consider UDON harmful for the environment") }}

The slowdown caused by this is especially noticeable and irritating in VR.

## Part Two
This second part of the post is about my work and is more subjective.
If you want to call it a day here, take this one lesson with you:

**Don't roll your own scripting language.**

Use [lua](https://www.lua.org/) like everyone in the industry or [web assembly](https://webassembly.org/), which seems very promising.
Both are on the roadmap for [ChilloutVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/), another social VR platform.

## Go fast
To mitigate these issues, I had to come up with a solution.
Or three.
They are listed here in chronological order.

I went to work after obtaining a copy of the [Mahjong table](https://booth.pm/en/items/2300392).

### Hooking
2021.06.05

If you aren't familiar with this practice, hooking refers to a practice in modding where you insert a piece of code into the original code that branches into your code. Then, after your code executes, you can continue at the intended location or return, preventing the original code from running.

I could now wait for the VM to execute, check if I needed to intervene and run the heavy workload outside the slow UDON runtime.
This helped mitigate the stutter issues I had with the Mahjong CPU.

The good:
- 100% compatibility:
This worked fine in all tested Worlds that integrated the table. Luckily, world creators never adjusted this portion, and if they had, nobody would notice.

The bad:
- limited to specific segments:
Since I could only intervene before the VM spun up, I had very rough control over what code I could replace.
- careful patches:
The original script had to change a lot to make it compatible.
- couldn't mitigate all slowdown:
To preserve compatibility, I had to skip the first frame of the CPU's turn, and only 13/14 lags were mitigated.

### Theseus ship
2021.08.09
{{ side_note(text="Is it still UDON if I replace all its parts?") }}

The next battle strategy was to replace VM entirely.
Calls to the VM would end up in native-run C# code.
Luckily the UDON VM was implemented in a set of interfaces so I could setup a "fake" VM that implements this interface.

Sadly this didn't work immediately as our modding framework didn't support interfaces.

This requires going a bit deeper into the implementation side.
As mentioned above, VRChat is a Unity3D game.
Game logic is written in C# as it's the primary scripting language of Unity.
The default runtime is mono, a CIL interpreter and JIT.

Unity also provides an alternative compiler and runtime called il2cpp.
IL refers to the bytecode language C# compiles to.
il2cpp takes this bytecode language and converts it to C++ code, which is then again compiled to native machine code.

This allows Unity games to run on platforms where JIT compilation isn't allowed, and interpreting is too slow.
Another side effect is that the game becomes significantly harder to mod or reverse engineer.

In early 2020 VRChat switched to il2cpp, probably because of this exact side effect.
With this change, modding, which previously injected CIL DLL's into the mono runtime, was on hold.
Eventually a solution was developed that could make old mods work again with only minor adjustments.
It consists of [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader), which provides the known mono runtime, and [Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower](https://github.com/knah/Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower), which provides all the glue to work with the entirely different environment.

Through Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower it's possible to inject your CIL classes that are accessible from the il2cpp side.
The short commings I had to face were in it's "ClassInjector", which I solved by forwarding information about implemented interfaces.
Missing still were generic methods on interfaces, which UDON used for accessing heap variables.

#### Generic Virtual
Looking into this made me curious.
Say you have a function `GetValue<T>()` on an interface `I`.
You might have multiple classes implementing `I` and multiple calls to `I::GetValue<T>()` with `T` being various types.

How does an ahead-of-time compiler know what code he should emit.
The solution il2cpp chose was to stamp out code for every possible combination of `I` and `T`, resulting in a gigantic pile of potentially unused code.
Lookups are done once at runtime and cached for performance reasons.

While the il2cpp compiler is proprietary, it's runtime library is provided by the Unity Editor, as games have to link against it.
Tracing down the callstack I found a good place to hook into.
Now when a generic method on an interface is first called, it will search through my injected classes and return those.
Since we live in CIL mono, we can stamp out the needed functions at runtime.

You can find my patch to Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower [here](https://github.com/knah/Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower/pull/71)

Now this I could finally hook up my own "fake" VM like so:
```cs
RegisterTypeInIl2CppWithInterfaces<FakeUdon.FakeUdonProgram>(true, typeof(IUdonProgram));
RegisterTypeInIl2CppWithInterfaces<FakeUdon.FakeUdonVM>(true, typeof(IUdonVM));
RegisterTypeInIl2CppWithInterfaces<FakeUdon.FakeUdonHeap>(true, typeof(IUdonHeap));
```

With this, no further changes to the Mahjong script had to be done.
See for yourself:

{{ video(path="/blog/udon/fast.webm", poster="/blog/udon/fast.jpg") }}

In this video, you can see four tables with four Mahjong bots, each playing simultaneously. However, even with those all running, the game is perfectly playable if you can tolerate the noise.

The good:
- Massive Speedup:
The Mahjong table execution is sped up by **factor 200**
- Generally applicable:
Adding new scripts requires no changes to the code

The bad:
- Huge initial effort: The initial investment was large
- Can't adapt to small changes

{{ side_note(text="Noticed how the tiles are clipping into the table?") }}

I published all the glue code as a library in November 2021 [here](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/UdonUtils) and let it rest.

At the end of December, I got messaged by Kitlith, who found the repository and was interested in speeding up Udon overall.
He started recreating the VM in C# but could only get ~80% of the speed of the original code.

(Explain the il2cpp modding/boxing-unboxing barrier?)

Through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), I had recently learned Rust which I used to write an [interpreter](https://github.com/kitlith/vrc_udon_shit/blob/target-codegen/native/src/vm/interpreter.rs). Without any special optimization, it immediately surpassed the original VM by 5-15%.

### JIT
A Just-in-Time compiler describes a runtime element that compiles code at runtime. Such compilers are found in most scripting languages, such as JavaScript, Ruby or Lua, and bytecode VMs like the JVM or mono.

The next attempt to write such a JIT compiler that converts UDON assembly into x86_64 machine code.


Check out our code, [here](https://github.com/kitlith/vrc_udon_shit)

Over time the progress has slowed as I've mostly stopped playing VRChat and only rarely played Mahjong and Kitlith (TODO?).

## The end?
On 2022.07.25, VRChat announced that they would ship the next version with Epic Games' "Easy Anti-Cheat". This would effectively prevent all of these efforts from ever working in-game again.
